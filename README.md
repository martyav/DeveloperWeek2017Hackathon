# DeveloperWeekNY2017Hackathon

ZAMHack is an integrated, fully mobile notification and monitoring system that allows neighborhood watch, security teams, or roving journalists to keep tabs on local events. Sensors on a camera or security system trigger a notification to an iPhone via Zang SMS services. The user can then click on the message to view a live stream, provided by Wowza, of the area. They can evaluate the situation and send a message via the built-in text field to alert other people or a customized bot.

ZAMHack won second place in DevWeekNY's Zang challenge, and honorable mention in DevWeekNY's Wowza challenge.
